Review
if you haven t gone here go now
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it s amazing what they do with eggplant
come hungry leave happy and stuffed
it s a great place and i highly recommend it
best of luck to the rude and non customer service focused new management
reasonably priced also
worst food service i ve had in a while
i had a seriously solid breakfast here
the service was terrible though
times very bad customer service
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse
the food wasn t good
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork
overall a great experience
i went to bachi burger on a friend s recommendation and was not disappointed
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale
all the bread is made in house
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter
they dropped more than the ball
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it to go the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for
if that bug never showed up i would have given a for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen
if it were possible to give them zero stars they d have it
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary s coming
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated
i was very disappointed
this place is like chipotle but better
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions
very disappointing
waitress was sweet and funny
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day
very friendly staff
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant
after i pulled up my car i waited for another minutes before being acknowledged
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless
i go to far too many places and i ve never seen any restaurant that serves a egg breakfast especially for
will be back again
the food was very good
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked
the food was excellent and service was very good
the goat taco didn t skimp on the meat and wow what flavor
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting minutes just to place our order another minutes before the food arrived
if you re not familiar check it out
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor
eew this location needs a complete overhaul
now the burgers aren t as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water
the staff are also very friendly and efficient
i could care less the interior is just beautiful
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for which is a decent deal
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a star
service was very prompt
the service was a bit lacking
but i definitely would not eat here again
before i go in to why i gave a star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review
the portion was huge
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous
couldn t ask for a more satisfying meal
will definitely be back
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer
the deal included tastings and drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected
i won t try going back there even if it s empty
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing
conclusion very filling meals
great place fo take out or eat in
it was way over fried
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place
it is perfect for a sit down family meal or get together with a few friends
service sucks
the kids play area is nasty
as much as i d like to go back i can t get passed the atrocious service and will never return
service was slow and not attentive
always a great time at dos gringos
i ve had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho
update went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about you just can t go wrong
the desserts were a bit strange
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we ll just go to ninja sushi next time
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut
food was so gooodd
a greasy unhealthy meal
which are small and not worth the price
i don t have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well
definitely will come back here again
i m so happy to be here
omelets are to die for
we d definitely go back here again
food quality has been horrible
they have a really nice atmosphere
he was terrible
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was ridiculous
fantastic service here
we were promptly greeted and seated
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach
i ve never been treated so bad
i got food poisoning here at the buffet
this was my first time and i can t wait until the next
the cr pe was delicate and thin and moist
the problem i have is that they charge for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables
the food was terrible
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying
service is quick and friendly
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch
terrible management
i didn t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom
no complaints
if you are reading this please don t go there
i hope this place sticks around
i d say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m s dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing
i heart this place
their steaks are recommended
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go
i m super pissd
not good for the money
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise
plus it s only bucks
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
the bartender was also nice
loved it friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu
i just don t know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine
waitress was good though
that s right the red velvet cake ohhh this stuff is so good
the service was meh
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside
service stinks here
worst thai ever
i m not impressed with the concept or the food
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place
like the other reviewer said you couldn t pay me to eat at this place again
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries i ve ever had
maybe if they weren t cold they would have been somewhat edible
this place is good
overpriced for what you are getting
these are the nicest restaurant owners i ve ever come across
probably not in a hurry to go back
im in az all the time and now have my new spot
i did not expect this to be so good
i was mortified
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for minutes
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus
the block was amazing
we won t be going back anytime soon
very very disappointed ordered the big bay plater
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i ve tried gets my seal of approval
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price
never again will i be dining at this place
good food good service
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made
fantastic food
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted
i loved it
real sushi lovers let s be honest yama is not that good
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle
definitely a turn off for me i doubt i ll be back unless someone else is buying
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty
very tough and very short on flavor
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked
the plantains were the worst i ve ever tasted
their daily specials are always a hit with my group
dont go here
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing
and it was way to expensive
this place deserves no stars
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasn t food
very slow at seating even with reservation
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
this place is horrible and way overpriced
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be over priced over hip and under services
hands down my favorite italian restaurant
it is worth the drive
won t go back
service was fantastic
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere
must have been an off night at this place
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon
today is the second time i ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good
the worst was the salmon sashimi
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman
went for lunch service was slow
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough
just had lunch here and had a great experience
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever
delicious
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no
and then tragedy struck
awful service
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount
the waiter wasn t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us
i could barely stomach the meal but didn t complain because it was a business lunch
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone
the fried rice was dry as well
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back
eclectic selection
based on the sub par service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won t be going back
the chips and sals a here is amazing
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world
what happened next was pretty off putting
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing
the pizza selections are good
not tasty and the texture was just nasty
no i m going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left
my order was not correct
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars
the selection was probably the worst i ve seen in vegas there was none
i can t tell you how disappointed i was
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what i ve been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
this was like the final blow
if the food isn t bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world s worst annoying drunk people
after all the rave reviews i couldn t wait to eat here what a disappointment
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing
everything was gross
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it
service is friendly and inviting
everything was perfect the night we were in
once you get inside you ll be impressed with the place
will never ever go back
sooooo good
i never come again
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki
the turkey and roast beef were bland
spend your money and time some place else
great atmosphere friendly and fast service
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won t be disappointed
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho
ryan s bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won t be revisiting
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable
food arrived quickly
the service was not up to par either
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table
mediocre food
i won t be back
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good
they have great dinners
i will be back many times soon
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did
spend your money elsewhere
owner s are really great people
first time there and might just be the last
a great touch
the live music on fridays totally blows
good value great food great service
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only others there eating
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives
this place is great
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service
waited hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did
for about minutes we we re waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn t coming any time soon
tonight i had the elk filet special and it sucked
the bathroom is just next door and very nice
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special
it wasn t busy at all and now we know why
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh
i d rather eat airline food seriously
the inside is really quite nice and very clean
pretty cool i would say
love the margaritas too
this place lacked style
strike who wants to be rushed
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean
